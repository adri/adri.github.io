Last week I learned about two caching techniques and how to combined them to get a more effective caching strategy. 

First I wanted to solve the **"dogpile" effect** which occurs when a cache expires during a traffic spike. Many users re-generate the just expired cache value and query the database. The more users hit the database, the slower and less responsive it gets. To prevent this, only the first user should re-generate a cache value while all other users receive a stale value until the cache is regenerated by the first user. Serving stale data is a better tradeoff than a database being overloaded. 

Then I learned about the **"Russian doll" approach** for caching template fragments. This is effective when composing templates with chunks of cached fragments. Using `updated_at` timestamps for cache keys of the fragments allows for individual cache updates and minimal re-rendering.

In my case a Symfony3 application using the [Twig Cache Extension](https://github.com/twigphp/twig-cache-extension)

```
{% cache 'v1` %}
    {% for item in items %}
        {% cache 'v1' item %}
            {# ... #}
        {% endcache %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endcache %}
```




In `events.twig.html`:
```html
{% cache event.cacheKey   %}
	<h1>event.title</h1>
	
  {% cache 'event_comments' ~ event.cacheKey   %}
			{{ render(controller('event_comments', event.comments)) }}
	{% endcache %}
	
{% endcache %}
```

In `event_comments.twig.html`:
```html
<ul class="comments">
    {% foreach (comment in event.comments) %}
				{{ render(controller('comment', comment)) }}
    {% endforeach %}
</ul>
```


What is the dogpile effect?
