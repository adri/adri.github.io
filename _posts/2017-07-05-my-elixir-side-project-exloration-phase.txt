I believe that to really learn a programming language, you have to get involved in a project. [Getting an overview of the Elixir language](/post/why-elixir-has-great-potential) was great. But to be able to **learn about the details of Elixir and its ecosystem** I needed a side-project.

## Finding a problem to solve
Like many developers who want to learn a new technology, I needed a problem to solve. I had to find a nail for the new hammer.

Luckily there was a need at my work for a planning poker tool that is integrated with Jira and works well with remote developers. 

## Estimations for Remote Teams
[Planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) is an estimation technique used in agile software development. Usually this is done with real paper cards. In a remote-friendly environment, real cards are not always useful. 

At work we used the web-based tool [PlanITpoker](http://www.planitpoker.com) for a while but we missed an integration with Jira, our issue tracker.  We also had some issues with people joining twice, when using the tool at the same time on the phone and on the notebook. 

To me this sounded like a nice challenge for learning Elixir. The challange involved **presence detection** of team members, **synchronising estimations** and **using external APIs**. I found my nail!

### The Plan

For a 

1. Import stories from Jira
2. Estimate 
3. Push estimations to Jira

## What I learned so far
- phoenix 1.3
- phoenix presence
- phoenix channels
- GitHub authentication
- jira api
- con_cache for caching

## Deployment
- heroku with [Github integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration)
- pryn

## What is Elixir particularly good for?
Having a background in mostly PHP and Javascript, I'd say Elixir can be used for 
- all those use-cases and additionally:

## What's next?

* Testing
* Cleanup 
	* credo
	* Think more about code structure and runtime concerns based on the article [To spawn, or not to spawn?](http://theerlangelist.com/article/spawn_or_not)
* GraphQL with Absinthe with subscriptions
* CI setup
