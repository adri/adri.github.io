I had a lot of fun learning Elixir during my [last side-project](/post/learning-elixir-first-side-project). For the last 1.5 years I'm working with GraphQL APIs. Now I wanted to learn **how to build GraphQL APIs with Elixir**. For me it was clear: I needed another side-project.

I was looking for a problem with a small domain but with some complexity. 

### Supermarket API

A few months ago we changed our grocery shopping habits. Instead of going to a store a few times a week, we now order ingredients via an app and get them delivered the next day. Usually we order two times a week. This change in habits meant that when ordering, we plan what we are going to eat in the next 3-4 days.
 
* avoid food waste
* don't run out of essentials 
* cook different recipes
