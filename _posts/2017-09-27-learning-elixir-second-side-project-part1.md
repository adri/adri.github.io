I had a lot of fun learning Elixir during my [last side-project](/post/learning-elixir-first-side-project). For the last 1.5 years I'm working with GraphQL APIs. Now I wanted to learn **how GraphQL APIs work in Elixir**. For me it was clear: I needed another side-project. 

![Elixir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/133832/30913555-ede256ac-a390-11e7-8f3a-b8e70b00e702.png)

I was looking for a problem with a small domain but with some complexity. The idea was born to speed up our grocery shopping by ordering recipes and their ingredients via a supermarket API. 

This is part 1 of a blog post series "Elixir side-project #2".
1. Plan recipes with a supermarket API (1/2)
2. *In progress:* A Graphql API with Elixir (2/2)

### Planning Recipes with a Supermarket API
A few months ago we changed our grocery shopping habits. Instead of going to a store a few times a week, we now order ingredients via an app and get them delivered the next day. Usually we order two times a week. When ordering, we plan what we are going to eat in the next 3-4 days.  
 
Every time when we order we think of recipes to cook and their ingredients. Then we add every ingredient to the app. We also added essential ingredients like milk or eggs if we needed them. 

Automating this process sounded fun. What is important for us:
* order enough ingredients and avoid throwing foodÂ away
* always have the essentials in stock without forgetting some
* prefer cooking with fresh ingredients over ready-made meals
* reduce the time it takes to order by automation but with the same result

### Picape
Picape is a website that we use to manage and order recipes and ingredients. Here a demo how this looks like:

<br />

The domain is very connected which makes it a great use-case for GraphQL. The main concepts are:

1. **Recipes**<br /> 
A list of recipes that can be planned. Those recipes have ingredients. When a recipe is planned, their ingredients get added automatically to the order via the supermarket API.  

2. **Essentials**<br />
Some ingredients should not be added automatically to the cart because they are always in stock. These are ingredients like herbs, milk products and frozen goods. Instead: if a recipe needs an essential, those should be highlighted only.  

3. **Ingredients**<br />
Every ingredient is mapped to a product in the supermarket API. Choosing a specific product and naming it reduces friction. E.g. I just order "tomato sauce" and don't think "which tomato sauce did I choose again?".   

4. **Order**<br />
A list of ingredients that have been added to cart and for which recipe they are planned. Payment happens via the app itself not via Picape.
