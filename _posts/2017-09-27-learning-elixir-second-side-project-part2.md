I made a GraphQL API and a web interface with next.js+apollo to [manage and order recipes and ingredients via a supermarket API](/post/learning-elixir-first-side-project).

### GraphQL and Elixir 
The most used GraphQL library for Elixir is [Absinthe](http://absinthe-graphql.org). The maintainers are very active on the 
[#absinthe-graphql Slack channel](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/) and they are [writing a book](https://pragprog.com/book/wwgraphql/craft-graphql-apis-in-elixir-with-absinthe).
