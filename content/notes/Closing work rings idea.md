"Closing the rings" for work. The Apple Watch motivates me to achieve activity goals, can the same be done for work goals?

### Goals
When I deploy more often, I have a greater sense of achievement. I change my thinking to "what is the smallest thing I can do towards my goal?". I help my collegues better by reviewing faster.  

I like to improve these habits while having fun doing it. I'll build a habit of more frequent smaller PRs and quick reviews. A automated coach can help me to nugde my behavior in the right direction.

### Non goals
- No controlling: There are tools that build statistics of teams on how they perform. This is not a tool for this use-case. To avoid misuse, data is stored locally only. 

### Habits
Apple Watch uses 3 goals: stand, exercise and move. What to use in a work context?

- **collaborate**: PRs reviewed 
- **deliver**: PRs merged
- **maintain**: PR merged that fixes an error, improves performance or code quality

Goals are daily and specific. I can set for example these goals:
- collaborate: 4 PRs reviewed (2 x of PRs merged)
- deliver: 2 PRs merged
- maintain: 1 "maintenance" PR merged

### Metrics
Next to the goals Apple Watch shows additional metrics like total steps, total distance and flights climbed.

- Avg time to PR review 
- Avg time to mer

### Motivation
To build a habit, it's important to stay engaged. Apple Watch uses three options to keep motivated.

#### Awards
When reaching personal bests or milestones  , awards can be received. For example: "200% of deliver goal reached".

#### Coaching
In the evening: "you're so close to closing your collaborate ring. One more review should do it."

#### Sharing
Encourage colleagues to participate or challenge each other. Gain points based on the percentage of activity rings closed.

### Questions
- Documentation and "thinking" is also a delivery, how to measure that?
- Dependabot PRs are easy wins, is that an issue? It's review, merge and maintenance. Automerge when green?
