When baking bread rolls or other small baking goods, steam is important so that the dough can rise in the oven. The humidity prevents the oven heat from drying out the top of the bread.

The steam is released often after half of the baking time to allow a crust to form.

### Steam cup  
Create steam in an oven:
- Metal cup or similar to hold lots of metal
- Steel balls 1,5-2kg to fill the cup
- PTFE (teflon) tube which inserted into the hot cup and connected to a syringe   
- Syringe 100ml to spray 50-60ml water at once into the steam cup. Fill the rest (40-50ml) with air to get all water through the tube

### Ideas
- Two baking sheets above each other, with the top one turned around so it creates a dutch oven like situation?
