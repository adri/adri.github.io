Tofu is a nice protein alternative to meat. However it can be quite blant and soft. That's why it's nice to use some soy sauce and sesame oil and bake it crispy. 

### How to
1. Choose the extra firm tofu
2. Cut in cubes and squeece moisture out
3. Marinade in soy sauce, sesame oil and starch
4. Bake it in the oven for 25-30 minutes

### Why in the oven?
Because when baking in a pan, the tofu can stick to the pan. When moving the tofu pieces rip apart. 

### Why getting the moisture out?
When the water is still in the outside of the tofu, tasteful fluids like soy sauce are not soaked up well. Also without the water, the outside can be baked crispier.

### Why starch?
 The starch makes the edges extra crispy. Idea from [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-crispy-tofu-without-deepfrying-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-201265)). 

### Which starch?
- Cornstarch is a more processed ingredient, but it yields the crispiest results
- Arrowroot works well, but the outer covering can turn a little slippery if added dish containing a lot of moisture (like curry)
- Tapioca is not tested yet
