[[Deliberate practice]] applied to my job as a developer and self observed feedback.

## Feedback
- PHPUnit boiler-plate like setting up dependencies takes a long time 
	=> Generate this code using a custom command
- When I don't have a list of ready made tasks, I get out of the flow, looking for what to do next
	=> Plan enough tasks that I can work off
- If I have a task that I don't like to work on, I look for other tasks that I could do instead 
	=> Prioritize so that I'm forced to take it
- Running PHPUnit > Manually scrolling up 
	=> Changed PHPStorm setting but still doesn't work
- Debugger not setup when testing
	=> Configured xdebug only in debug PHPUnit (but sometimes doesn't work)
