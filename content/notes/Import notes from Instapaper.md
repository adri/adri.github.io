### Instapaper
I store articles on blogs/website in the read-it-later service [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com).  Instapaper has an iOS app and sends articles to the Kindle once a week. 

### How I use it
Although I do like the idea of reading later. I'm rarely reading stored articles back. Why ist that? 
- Often I read the article straight on the website, there is no need to read it again later 
- I often read on the notebook but the instapaper website is slow and not designed well
- Opening the Instapaper app feels like a todo-list instead of super exciting
-  Finding information with Instapaper is not working for me because: 
	- Search is a paid feature in Instapaper, and I don't want to pay
	- It's faster to find the article again via Google
	- I sometimes copy the link to an article (source) in my notes and find it back like that
 
### Idea
Reading articles more with the goal of extracting ideas and linking them to existing ideas according to the [[Zettelkasten principles]] would be cool to learn more efficiently and find back information easier.

 Copy every article that I save to Instapaper into my notes as markdown files. That way:
 - I can always access the articles in the future
 - I can link to articles in my notes
 - I can search offline (fast) 
 
### Implementation
[IFTT](https://ifttt.com/instapaper) can be used but it doesn't contain the content of the article.
