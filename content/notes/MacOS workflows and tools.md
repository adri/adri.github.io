Tools I use on macOS.

1. macOS
    - US [keyboard](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/usgermankeyboard) layout with German Umlauts via Option Key
    - Homebrew with [Brewfile](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew) to manage installed software via a configuration
    - Sensible [defaults](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos) as needed
2. Terminal
	To run commands I use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/). 
	- [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
	  This shell has great autosuggestions and good performance. I switched to it because all my zsh plugins slowed down the terminal. Fish has great defaults.
	- [itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil)
	  To open up multiple split windows in a pre-defined configuration.
	- Show command times [[2013-08-07-shell-show-time-last-command-took]]
