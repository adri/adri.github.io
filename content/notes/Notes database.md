Collect notes from all sorts of sources into one big linked "database". Over time this builds a valuable knowledge graph.

- [[Don't use tags for note organization]]
- [[Feynman technique to learn things]]
- [[Building a second brain]]

### Choosing the right format
The most future proof format for data is **plain text**. For example in the form of CSV, Markdown, YAML and so on. Technology changes fast, databases and SAAS come and go. The source of truth should always be plain text, so that the data is available for many years. Loading data into a database is fine, as long as the source format is plain text.
