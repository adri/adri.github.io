Ovens have different settings for distributing heat and steam. 

### Steam
If the oven has a steam function, use it so bread (rolls) rise well in the oven. If not[[Create steam in an oven]].

### Upper and lower heat 
Unless the oven has a steam function use the static upper and lower heat setting instead of the the circulating air. The this avoids the surface of the bread (rolls) from drying out and being unable to rise.  

### Core temperature
Because each oven is different, the temperature setting has to be adjusted after gaining some experience. The temperature at the middle (core) of the bread (roll) should be 95-98°C after baking.
