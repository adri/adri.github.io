### Inverse a problem
Given a problem or goal, think of negative outcomes and how to prevent them. The idea is to not only focus on the positive but also on how to avoid the negative. Why?

* It can help to understand a problem better by considering different perspectives
* It's often easy to avoid negatives which leads to better outcomes. See also [[Deliberate practice]]

### Example: Innovation
Improving innovation in an organization can be done by thinking about ways how to stimulate innovation. However also consider the inverse: What is done to discourage innovation? How can it be avoided?
