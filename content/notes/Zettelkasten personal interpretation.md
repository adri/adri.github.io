I'm often not doing anything with the knowledge in my "wiki". I tried mind maps to connect information, however I never had great tools to search and organize information. The format is also often not plain text which makes it hard to script and use in the future when the tools become obsolete.

### How a Zettelkasten can help me
- Be more productive by using my "external brain" more often
- Think more about how to relate new ideas to existing ideas
- Make a 'train of thought' visible
- Write down things more often

For example: I can use the notes to store things Iâ€™d otherwise need to look up on the internet like shell programming tricks. I link each note to other notes.
